## The problem:
Tunisia has an issue with food waste: A recent source (African Manager, 2017) states that the average food waste of Tunisian families is about 17 dinars per month, leading to 5% of total food expenditure (356 dinars per month). 

According to a study published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), “The annual rate of food waste per individual is around 16% in North Africa and Central Asia, 34% in Europe, 31% in Asia, 39% in North America, and 11% in Latin America”. 

## The solution:
The solution to limit the food waste problem in Tunisia is to develop an online platform where multiple businesses, such as hotels, bakeries, restaurants & supermarkets, can sell any excess food items they have due to overproduction or short-shell life for a much lower price. 

The existence of such a platform can allow people with low income specifically to purchase high-quality food at an affordable price, especially at a time when the local Tunisian market is suffering from multiple shortages.
